# MicroMeeting
## Overview
MicroMeeting is an Open Source app to improve the colective experience (CX) of participants attending conferences.  
In order to improve such experience our product aims at taking down social barriers and promoting social interaction between participants.  

## Planned Features
This is a work in progress project. Nevertheless, we have some great ideas for our app.  
Here are some examples of what you should be able to do when our product is ready:
* Pair with someone else near you to start a conversation based on mutual interests;
* Exchange personal or professional information seamlessly with a tap of a button;
* Manage your profile information (picture, name, job, etc.) so people can know who you are and what you do;
* Discover a new and funny way to socialize using the [Micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) technology.
